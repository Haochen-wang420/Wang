<h1>Personal information</h1>

<p>My name is Haochen Wang, I am from Jiangsu China, so I speak Chinese, it has a long history and famous culture, now I study in Melbourne’s RMIT University. My student number here is s3701719, so my email address is s3701719@student.rmit.edu.au. I am now in bachelor of information technology since 20th Jun 2020, because I want to get some particular job to develop my talent, maybe robots’ control technology. After my basic information, and I will refer other of my information about something belong to my favor, cooking, because of COVID-19, I do afraid that takeout’s package may contain virus, so I learn how to cook. I have cooked many meals and I have cooked meal for many times, so I have more and more interests. Now let’s show you my branch of IT: Robotic Control.</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>

<p>I have said that I study IT, I am interested in science technology rather than engineering. Among science technology, I am interested in IT. Because IT is in almost all the aspects of our current life, and it can makes our life and connection faster and more nimble and more quick. However, in IT, I interest in robot controlling. Before the middle of 2020, I have got the interest in IT in robots. Initially, I want to study all the basic ideas about IT, then, when I start to get master or doctor, I can have a particular IT, which is robot controlling and study further to become expert. Also I have touched with many kinds of advanced robots, they are all controlled by information technology to do some particular works. Like sensor, programmed information in computer, and microcomputer that used to store some data and information. And sensor is used to detect which was which, that is an excellent tooling. For example, vacuum robot cleaner from iRobot Inc, it has a microcomputer can remember the area, landform, and furniture location in some particular house. This can make the robot works conveniently.  So that is my experience to get touched with robots. For another example, when I take a journey, it is no doubt that I need to live in hotel. Once a time, I saw a service robot. I did some experiment, I put some stuff in the robot’s box, then I starts it to send the stuff to my room. He knows the location of the lift and the location of my room number. Not only, also it can call the elevator to go to particular level of the hotel. And it went to my room and call the telephone of my room. This is very interesting. This stimulate my interest in IT instead of mechanical technology. Now many robots have simple mechanical system, but have complex computer and information system. So I want to explore robots’ controlling system in my future. That is not only relevant to IT, but also a core to robots. 

Because my level of study in VCE high school, I have got a neither so good, nor so bad result. To be my best, I study in RMIT, this is really a good college in the world although not in 100 of the universities in the world. It has many interesting technologies in science and business, this is a pretty good integrity university. I love it and has interesting activities. As my thought, RMIT as a technology college, it must has an advanced major in IT. 

So I really expect to study sensor technology, data storage, communication, and especially how the information technology makes a robot’s arm do actions, that is the core of a robot. As long as I get enough knowledge of information technology, that is not a problem to study in postgraduate. Thus I can also understand the relevant ideas between electrical system and IT. When I in job, the design of the mechanical system is no problem. 
</p>

<h1>Ideal job</h1>

<p>Because I have said that I am interested in robots. So I would like to get ideal job about the robots to have a deeper and deeper understanding of the controlling system, like I work in some robot technology company like iRobot company, or robot institution to invent novelty. Just like advertisement photo about ALPHA 2 robot from UBTECH Inc. below. available at: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/alpha-2-the-first-humanoid-robot-for-the-family#/
It was very miraculous when the world’s first robot got invented. It can do some particular works instead of human, to reduce casualties in dangerous occasions. In present day, there are some particular robots that can have artificial intelligence, they can study and avoid all the mistakes they experience. It has extreme accurate calculation in all the aspects of gravity, parabola, distance, height, time and strength. It can remember the landform, they can identify which to put where and remember what item is in which location, know which is rubbish and throw it and know which is weed and removes it, they can even communicate with people in entertainment, in home, in work like ALPHA 2 robot above. This brain ability is very excellent even more than people’s, it appeals to me. But common! It does not mean that it excess human, but higher and higher technology, because there are also some other tiny things that are undefinable by it, I am pretty hope that artificial technology will get in the fourth industrial revolution decades later. 

This technology of course need enough skills on sensor technology, and programming technology, and also database storage science, and any of other devices that calculate distance and time, with these assistants, robot can works perfectly. So this need people to understand the structure, how computer hardware works, how computer control the robot, and how program is done and how sensor works. It also relates to some of my own experience. When I was in associate degree, I have done some program to let some mechatronic system to do works, to let them operate which part of their mechanical device. My first experience in robotic control is just a little and simple programming to control 3 devices in a mechatronic system. I do currently have this simple skill in programming. My plan is undisputed, I need to study postgraduate maybe in world’s famous university, also I can choose any colleges in the US. I will try my best to get master or doctor degree to achieve my objectives

<h1>Personal profile</h1>
    
<img src=

<p>I have got three tests: Myers-Briggs Test, Learning Style Test and Creativity Test. These are the results, it relevant to my future’s work, it also needs me to collaborate in a team. 
 
 
 
The first screenshot is my Myers-Briggs Test, second is learning style test and the third is creativity result. It is a good thing to get extraverted, this can makes me solve more and more problems. I always have intuitive energy, just depends on my good mood after a good sleep results in sudden interest. This can produce energy to my heart and mind to study in high spirits. Besides, I have got interests in IT. It is good to feeling some particular systems’ working process in IT or any other science and technology. And then understand it. However, when it gets problem, or when we want to invent something unprecedent, we have to thinking. I know that in my future, I will face to some problems, thinking and exploring the issues is a only one method to develop, because when I understand the entire system and entire device, I can think and I can explore and fix it. Also, In my future, I want to invent something new to give people more and more convenience and more free time to spend on important works. This also let me think and then design. We have to consider before we plan. So judging is a better choice. Of course, we can plan and prospect, but it always has error, and it makes us get in unnecessary troubles. We have to be confident positively, because everyone is the same, as long as works hard and trust themselves, they will not fail and regret. More turbulent, makes the events worse. When I study, I need to understand the information in the first step and write down notes. Thus I can do reading and watching to study further. However, I have not get a work, so it does not matter to have low tactile. Also, because I am a student for now, and because of COVID-19, I have no time to join some activities to improve my ability of creativity. However, after this pandemic, I will pretty sure to join some activities, and in holiday, I works intern to improve my action. In a team, I can be extraverted, so I can get along with others. Because my team is same as me, they also study IT, I am also like it, It makes me have spirit to improve myself. I can feel and I can judge myself and also I can be confident, but I need to hear the others’ mind, so I can get an accurate result after a while. I need to be creative so I can improve my action of hands. If I really want to take them into my mind, I need to tell myself: Getting along, collaborating, considering the others are the most important.

<h1>Project idea</h1>

<p>OVERVIEW: I am interested in science and technology, I have just get interests in information technology. Information technology is famous all over the world, and it also has an important usage in robots. So the project of information technology here is robotic control. Robotic control technology is also a main branch in information technology. When I get in this project, I do believe that I can understand the initial technology to control a robot, maybe an example of programming. I need to program the robot to do some actions one after the next programmed instruction without its own sensing. Because study a technique, difficulty should be higher and higher gradually, this can makes me success. Then I can study sensor and database to let a robot work even more advanced. Then the best is artificial intelligence, this can makes a robot study without programming, eliminate more and more mistakes which are experienced and recorded. 

MOTIVATION: Just like one example like vacuum cleaner robot from iRobot company, the plan is between 2015 and 2025. In 2018, it shows that the robot was almost at 2 billion dollars in market of US. And it is predicted that in this situation, the robot will have the values in market can almost reach to 5 billion dollars in final year’s plan. This shows us that the popularity of the modern domestic robots. Not only vacuum cleaner robot, but also the other robots that used in rural life like electric robotic vehicle from Naio Technologies company from France. It use GPS to navigate and use sensors to define weeds and removes it, also it can remember the landform of one particular field. This is a perfect technology on sensors and database storage. That will makes me interesting and feel useful in my project.

DESCRIPTION: My project of information technology is robotic control, so I can refer to some products and their service. Just like a domestic robot invented by Toyota and Tokyo University. This robot has many devices and structures, it is humanoid, it has two arms for working, five image camera for visual sensing, laser sensor for distance calculation and the under wheel for moving. It is demonstrated just after its birth. It can do many kinds of housework, for example, it can takes the dishes from dining table and then clean the dishes up and then put the dishes back in cabinet. It can also sweeps up the floor and mops the floor. Not only this, also it can use its other sensors to detect what the furniture is and what the object is and what it is used for. Also it has a learning ability, it can record some failure before and avoid it. Because recently people are too busy for their works to do housework, so they do use the robots to substitute themselves. If where here is a high technology, there will be the best service. Also, there are many other humanoid robots like DIGIT robot from Agility Robotics Inc to carry stuff for market, home, industry, or farm. It can use sensors and camera to navigate and detect obstacles and it can keep balance like human and without falling down when walking on uneven terrain or go up and down stairs. Which results in no hitch to deliver package. And there are so many robots that serve in restaurants, the big, or bigger, or the biggest restaurant. These robots can deliver meals to customers. Initially, customer pay the bill and workers in restaurant give them the table number. Robots database record the location of the tables and the landform of the restaurant. It has sensors to detect whether someone or another robot is in front of it and then make a detour of itself to prevent from bumping. When a robot receives a meal and which meal is belong to which table number, it can find the nearest way to send the meal to the relevant customer. When two robots face to face, they do take the detour each other, one takes the detour in one side maybe left or right, and another one detour the route opposite of the first robot’s detour route. Also, there is another micromouse robot in Japan, it is called Min 7.1. In maze competition, it can eventually solve an extreme difficult maze in nearly 4 seconds. When the robot initially goes into the maze, it use camera and sensors to navigate the maze and records the route until it finds the exit. Then it uses its recorded route to find the nearest way to finish the puzzle. As the robot walk through the maze again and again, the time that it solve the maze becomes shorter and shorter. As many products shows above, the featured function of a robot is to use computer as a person’s brain to keep balance. High quality data storage device is a good memory for a robot to record and remember the landform to let it easy to do service work. Cameras are their eyes and now this technology is advanced, because it has referred that DIGIT robot can navigate and avoid front obstacle. These are the best feature to become a robot’s better and better service, and I am pretty hope that scientists can invent more and more novelties.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES: As an advanced robot, it must have their own tools and own technology to achieve a high technology’s efficiency. It is undisputed that it needs many hardware to let it get started and do some works, like some computer device and circuit system, and of course, we need to use some software to program it, to give the robots instruction. Also sometimes, complex software system can make a robot to study as a newbie in some particular field, after a long time, it can handle everything in this field without error. Of course, some common domestic robots can get started by software in our phone, also called APP. Like one APP called Neato Robotics. This APP initially connect to some robots like vacuum cleaner, then it stores the map of your house and you can use it to start or stop your robot, also it can show you that what is your robot’s situation. Its kernel hardware is microcomputer, this device has multiple function, once its connected to Neato Robotics, it do receive the instruction and let the robot work, it can store the map of your house, it can contact your APP randomly. That is wonderful!!

SKILLS REQUIRED: To get a better and better understand and become an elite, we must need skills. The skill is to operate the relevant things on software or hardware. We firstly need to study and understand this system’s process and structure at the first step. We need to understand robots’ hardware and devices’ location to stall it. If there are some problems, we can find the source of the error. And then we need to use software to program it, to use software order the robots to do something particular, software belong to some robots that can be used for us to write program. Microcomputer is a hardware sometimes we do let it store some data that it experienced and recorded. This need us to pay attention to everything for it to work. Just give some vital examples of this instruction, we need to let it firstly understand the entire map of some particular zone, we need it to record and store the area, and all the rooms’ length, width, and furniture location. We need the robot to understand what its task everyday. It is very feasible that the robot get this features, feasible robots can do many complex and tedious things that instead of people. As long as they use software and hardware to understand basic ideas about shape of a room, and what job to let it do, which items should be putted and keep balance, that is advanced society and people can feel a happiness

OUTCOMES: I am pretty hope that the project can be very successful. Because we do understand a system’s construction and working process in particular. It can have a better outcome. Before this modern period, robot could only be programmed to do some actions, so it still need people to waste their times, if people were busy, robot may miss many details. Fortunately, there is a sensor and any other devices, sensors can be defined in many methods to transfer information. They can see, they can hear, they can understand settled language. When people are busy, robots can substitute them to use more detailed and more advance programming to work without any details that get missed. Higher technology has positive effects, they can give people convenience and as long as there is a higher advanced AI and robot study, higher advanced features in IT and there is more convenient.
